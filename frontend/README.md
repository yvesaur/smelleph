 <h2> Description </h2>
 <p> SMELLE is an E-commerce website for various japanese cuisine. Our website is completely responsive and works smoothly on different devices. Our website is also dynamic which means editing the menu/offers to the firebase console will also reflect to our users, we can edit the menu, user, offers without directly editing the source code. The hosting is done on Google's firebase, they offer free website hosting for students. The database we also use comes from the Firebase, it is realtime so it's not a problem if there are many users entering data simultaneously. The website is coded on visual studio code using Javascript, CSS and HTML as programming/scripting language. We used React for designing the UI for our website. </p>
